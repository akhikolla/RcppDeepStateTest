Description: BAREB, a BAyesian REpulsive Biclustering model,   
    that can simultaneously cluster the Periodontal diseases (PD) patients 
    and their tooth sites after taking the patient- and site-level covariates into consideration. 
    BAREB uses the determinantal point process (DPP) prior to induce diversity 
    among different biclusters to facilitate parsimony and interpretability. 
    Essentially, BAREB is a cluster-wise linear model based on Yuliang (2019) <arXiv:1902.05680>.
