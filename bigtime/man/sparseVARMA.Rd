}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A \eqn{T} by \eqn{k} matrix of time series. If k=1, a univariate autoregressive moving average model is estimated.}

\item{U}{A \eqn{T} by \eqn{k} matrix of (approximated) error terms. Typical usage is to have the program estimate a high-order VAR model (Phase I) to get approximated error terms U.}

\item{VARp}{User-specified maximum  autoregressive lag order of the PhaseI VAR. Typical usage is to have the program compute its own maximum lag order based on the time series length.}

\item{VARpen}{"HLag" (hierarchical sparse penalty) or "L1" (standard lasso penalty) penalization in PhaseI VAR.}

\item{VARlseq}{User-specified grid of values for regularization parameter in the PhaseI VAR. Typical usage is to have the program compute
its own grid. Supplying a grid of values overrides this. WARNING: use with care.}

\item{VARgran}{User-specified vector of granularity specifications for the penalty parameter grid of the PhaseI VAR:  First element specifies
how deep the grid should be constructed. Second element specifies how many values the grid should contain.}

\item{VARalpha}{a small positive regularization parameter value corresponding to squared Frobenius penalty in PhaseI VAR. The default is zero.}

\item{VARMAp}{User-specified maximum autoregressive lag order of the VARMA. Typical usage is to have the program compute its own maximum lag order based on the time series length.}

\item{VARMAq}{User-specified maximum moving average lag order of the VARMA. Typical usage is to have the program compute its own maximum lag order based on the time series length.}

\item{VARMApen}{"HLag" (hierarchical sparse penalty) or "L1" (standard lasso penalty) penalization in the VARMA.}

\item{VARMAlPhiseq}{User-specified grid of values for regularization parameter corresponding to the autoregressive coefficients in the VARMA. Typical usage is to have the program compute
its own grid. Supplying a grid of values overrides this. WARNING: use with care.}

\item{VARMAPhigran}{User-specified vector of granularity specifications for the penalty parameter grid corresponding to the autoregressive coefficients in the VARMA:  First element specifies
how deep the grid should be constructed. Second element specifies how many values the grid should contain.}

\item{VARMAlThetaseq}{User-specified grid of values for regularization parameter corresponding to the moving average coefficients in the VARMA. Typical usage is to have the program compute
its own grid. Supplying a grid of values overrides this. WARNING: use with care.}

\item{VARMAThetagran}{User-specified vector of granularity specifications for the penalty parameter grid corresponding to the moving average coefficients in the VARMA:  First element specifies
how deep the grid should be constructed. Second element specifies how many values the grid should contain.}

\item{VARMAalpha}{a small positive regularization parameter value corresponding to squared Frobenius penalty in  VARMA. The default is zero.}

\item{h}{Desired forecast horizon in time-series cross-validation procedure.}

\item{cvcut}{Proportion of observations used for model estimation in the time series cross-validation procedure. The remainder is used for forecast evaluation.}

\item{eps}{a small positive numeric value giving the tolerance for convergence in the proximal gradient algorithms.}

\item{VARp}{Maximum autoregressive lag order of the PhaseI VAR.}
\item{VARPhihat}{Matrix of estimated autoregressive coefficients of the Phase I VAR.}
