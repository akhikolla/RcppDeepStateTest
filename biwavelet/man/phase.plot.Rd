\title{Plot phases with arrows}
\usage{
phase.plot(x, y, phases, arrow.len = min(par()$pin[2]/30,
  par()$pin[1]/40), arrow.col = "black", arrow.lwd = arrow.len * 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{X-coordinates}

\item{y}{Y-coordinates}

\item{phases}{Phases}

\item{arrow.len}{Size of the arrows. Default is based on plotting region.}

\item{arrow.col}{Arrow line color.}

\item{arrow.lwd}{Width/thickness of arrows.}
}
\description{
Plot phases with arrows
}
\note{
Arrows pointing to the right mean that \code{x} and \code{y} are in phase.

Arrows pointing to the left mean that \code{x} and \code{y} are in anti-phase.

Arrows pointing up mean that \code{y} leads \code{x} by \eqn{\pi/2}.

Arrows pointing down mean that \code{x} leads \code{y} by \eqn{\pi/2}.

Huidong Tian provided a much better implementation of the phase.plot function
that allows for more accurate phase arrows.

Original code based on WTC MATLAB package written by Aslak Grinsted.
