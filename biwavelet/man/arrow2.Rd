\title{This is an alternative helper function that plots arrows.
It uses \code{\link{text}()} to print a character using a default font.
This way, it is possible to render different types of arrows.}
\usage{
arrow2(x, y, angle, size = 0.1, col = "black",
  chr = intToUtf8(10139))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{X-coordinate of the arrow.}

\item{y}{Y-coordinate of the arrow.}

\item{angle}{Angle in radians.}

\item{size}{Similar to \code{arrow.len} parameter. Notice that we don't need
the \code{arrow.lwd} anymore}

\item{col}{Color of the arrow.}

\item{chr}{Character representing the arrow. You should provide the character
as escaped UTF-8.}
}
