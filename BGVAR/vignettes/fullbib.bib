These questions have been previously studied using SVARs identified with sign and zero restrictions and the answers have been positive and definite in both cases. While the identification of SVARs with sign and zero restrictions is theoretically attractive because it allows the researcher to remain agnostic with respect to the responses of the key variables of interest, we show that current implementation of these techniques does not respect the agnosticism of the theory. These algorithms impose additional sign restrictions on variables that are seemingly unrestricted that bias the results and produce misleading confidence intervals. We provide an alternative and efficient algorithm that does not introduce any additional sign restriction, hence preserving the agnosticism of the theory. Without the additional restrictions, it is hard to support the claim that either optimism shocks are an important source of business cycle fluctuations or deficit-financed tax cuts work best at improving output. Our algorithm is not only correct but also faster than current ones.},

We call this family of conjugate posteriors normal-generalized-normal. Our algorithms draw from a conjugate uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart posterior over the orthogonal reduced-form parameterization and transform the draws into the structural parameterization; this transformation induces a normal-generalized-normal posterior over the structural parameterization. The uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart posterior over the orthogonal reduced-form parameterization has been prominent after the work of Uhlig (2005). We use Beaudry, Nam, and Wang's (2011) work on the relevance of optimism shocks to show the dangers of using alternative approaches to implementing sign and zero restrictions to identify SVARs like the penalty function approach. In particular, we analytically show that the penalty function approach adds restrictions to the ones described in the identification scheme.},

	in the euro area to Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE)
	and its subregions Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, Russia, and
	the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
	To this effect, we apply a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model
	and go beyond existing work by examining the relative importance
	of the financial channel compared with the trade channel. Moreover,
	we assume that shocks spill over from the euro area to the CESEE
	region via the financial channel whereas financial spillovers within
	CESEE are negligible (except for spillovers between Russia and the
	other CESEE countries, which we do capture). Our results are as follows:
	We find spillovers transmitted via the trade channel to be larger
	than spillovers via the financial channel for Southeastern Europe,
	but smaller for Russia and the other CIS countries. For Central Europe,
	the two channels have a broadly similar impact. When we assess the
	relative importance of the two channels based on how well they explain
	historical movements in the data we see that spillovers via the two
	channels have indeed been of equal importance for Central Europe.
	However, the financial channel has traditionally dominated the trade
	channel in Southeastern Europe, whereas the trade channel has traditionally
	played a stronger role for the CIS region. Overall spillovers reflecting
	both transmission channels are comparatively more moderate for Central
	Europe and Russia, while they are a bit larger for Southeastern Europe
	and considerably higher for the CIS region excluding Russia: The
	long-run effect of a +1\% euro area output shock ranges from 0.3\%
	in Central Europe and Russia to 0.7\% in the other CIS countries.},

However, the estimates are very imprecise, which we suggest reflects the poor quality of instruments used in estimation.

  abstract = {In contrast to a posterior analysis given a particular sampling model,
	posterior model probabilities in the context of model uncertainty
	are typically rather sensitive to the specification of the prior.
	In particular, 'diffuse' priors on model-specific parameters can
	lead to quite unexpected consequences. Here we focus on the practically
	relevant situation where we need to entertain a (large) number of
	sampling models and we have (or wish to use) little or no subjective
	prior information. We aim at providing an 'automatic' or 'benchmark'
	prior structure that can be used in such cases. We focus on the Normal
	linear regression model with uncertainty in the choice of regressors.
	We propose a partly noninformative prior structure related to a Natural
	Conjugate $g$-prior specification, where the amount of subjective
	information requested from the user is limited to the choice of a
	single scalar hyperparameter $g_{0j}$. The consequences of different
	choices for $g_{0j}$ are examined. We investigate theoretical properties,
	such as consistency of the implied Bayesian procedure. Links with
	classical information criteria are provided. In addition, we examine
	the finite sample implications of several choices of $g_{0j}$ in
	a simulation study. The use of the MC$^3$ algorithm of Madigan and
	York (1995), combined with efficient coding in Fortran, makes it
	feasible to conduct large simulations. In addition to posterior criteria,
	we shall also compare the predictive performance of different priors.
	A classic example concerning the economics of crime will also be
	provided and contrasted with results in the literature. The main
	findings of the paper will lead us to propose a 'benchmark' prior
	specification in a linear regression context with model uncertainty.<P>(This

	autoregressive models have been proposed as an alternative approach

	In recent years such models have been increasingly used to identify

	that sign restrictions alone are insufficient to infer the responses
	of the real price of oil to such shocks. Moreover, the conventional
	assumption that all admissible models are equally likely is routinely
	violated in oil market models, calling into question the use of median
	responses to characterize the responses to structural shocks. When
	combining sign restrictions with additional empirically plausible
	bounds on the magnitude of the short-run oil supply elasticity and
	on the impact response of real activity, however, it is possible
	to reduce the set of admissible model solutions to a small number
	of qualitatively similar estimates. The resulting model estimates
	are broadly consistent with earlier results regarding the relative
	importance of demand and supply shocks for the real price of oil
	based on structural VAR models identified by exclusion restrictions,

	a g-prior on the coefficients of each model. In addition, we assign
	a hyperprior to g, as the choice of g has been found to have a large
	impact on the results. For the prior on g, we examine the Zellner-Siow
	prior and a class of Beta shrinkage priors, which covers most choices
	in the recent literature. We propose a benchmark Beta prior, inspired
	by earlier findings with fixed g, and show it leads to consistent
	model selection. The effect of this prior structure on penalties
	for complexity and lack of fit is described in some detail. Inference
	is conducted through a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler over model

	policy stance when the ZLB becomes binding. This facilitates the
	assessment of the policy stance against familiar Taylor rule benchmarks.

	a factor augmented VAR (FAVAR) that extends the model in Bernanke,
	Boivin, and Eliasz (2005) to the open economy. The main results can
	be summarized as follows. First, the dynamic effects on the UK economy
	of an unanticipated fall of short-term interest rates in the rest
	of the world are: real house price inflation, investment, GDP and
	consumption growth peak after 1 year, wages peak after 2 years, and
	CPI and GDP deflator inflation peak during the third year. Second,
	a positive international supply shock makes the distribution of the
	components of the UK consumption deflator negatively skewed. Third,
	in response to a domestic monetary shock, we find little evidence
	of the exchange rate and liquidity puzzles and little evidence of
	the forward discount and price anomalies. Copyright (c) 2009 Crown

	A researcher estimates a VAR on an infinite amount of data generated

	must be imposed -- more than what is typically imposed in applied
	work. Second, the variance of the shock under study must be sufficiently

  abstract={This paper develops tests of policy ineffectiveness when counterfactual outcomes, namely the predicted values of the target variable in the absence of a policy change, are obtained using reduced form or final form ‚Äòpolicy response equations‚Äô. The policy response equation explains the target variable by lags of itself and by current and lagged values of the policy variable and policy-invariant exogenous variables. These tests complement those in Pesaran and Smith (2015), which are done in the context of complete systems of macroeconometric dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) under rational expectations (RE). While there would be efficiency gains from using the complete system, were it fully known and correctly specified, this is rarely the case. Instead, since the counterfactual is a type of forecast and parsimonious models tend to forecast better than complex ones, we may obtain more reliable estimates of the counterfactual outcomes from a parsimonious policy response equation. We consider two types of policy intervention, a discretionary policy change where there is a deterministic change to the policy variable, and a rule-based policy change where one or more parameters of a stochastic policy rule are changed. We examine the asymptotic distributions and power of the tests under various assumptions. The proposed test for a discretionary policy change is illustrated with an application to the unconventional monetary policy known as quantitative easing (QE) adopted in the UK.},

	motives of banks that still remained undercapitalized after the OMT
	announcement. While banks that benefited from the announcement increased
	their overall loan supply, this supply was mostly targeted towards
	low-quality firms with pre-existing lending relationships with these
	banks. As a result, there was no positive impact on real economic
	activity like employment or investment. Instead, these firms mainly
	used the newly acquired funds to build up cash reserves. Finally,

	programme (APP) announced in January 2015 and assess its main transmission
	channels. We do so by first extending a term structure model with
	bond supply effects to account for assets with different types of
	risk premia. We then derive model-based predictions for cross-asset
	price movements associated with the transmission channels identified
	in the model. We finally validate empirically these predictions by
	means of an event- study methodology, reaching the following conclusions:
	The impact of the APP on asset prices is sizeable albeit the programme
	was announced at a time of low financial distress. This may appear
	puzzling in light of existing literature that finds a large impact
	of asset purchases only in periods of high financial distress. Consistent
	with the model, we explain this apparent puzzle by showing how the
	low financial distress, while indeed weakening certain transmission
	channels, has reinforced other channels because of its interplay
	with the asset composition of the programme. Targeting assets at
	long maturity and spanning the investment-grade space have supported
	the duration and the credit channels. At the same time, the low degree
	of financial stress prevailing at announcement of the programme,
	while weakening the local supply channel, has facilitated spill-overs

	Standard practice requires that a decision is made as to which indicators
	the central bank is assumed to respond to, ignoring the data-rich
	environment in which policy-makers typically form their decisions.
	However, the choice of the feedback variables in the estimations
	of simple rules bears non-trivial implications for the prescriptions
	borne from these rules. This paper addresses this issue for the euro
	area using a new comprehensive real-time database for the euro area
	and examines the ECB???s past interest-rate setting behaviour in
	two complementary ways that are designed to deal with both model
	and data uncertainty. In a first step we follow the ???thick-modelling???
	approach suggested by Granger and Jeon (2004) and estimate a series
	of 3,330 policy rules. In a second step we employ a factor-model
	approach similar to Bernanke and Boivin (2003) for the US Fed, but
	with structurally interpretable factors ? la Belviso and Milani (2006).
	Taken together, we find a strong justification for the need of adopting
	robust approaches to describe the historical evolution of euro area
	monetary policy. We also find that the ECB is neither purely backward
	nor forward-looking, but reacts to a synthesis of the available information

	generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact
	of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations

	Three issues appear central to this disagreement: (1) the specific
	type of changes in the policy coefficients, (2) the treatment of
	heteroskedasticity, and (3) the real-time nature of the data used.
	This paper addresses these issues in the context of forward-looking
	Taylor rules with drifting coefficients. The estimation is based
	on real-time data and accounts for the presence of heteroskedasticity
	in the policy shock. The findings suggest important but gradual changes
	in the rule coefficients, not adequately captured by the usual split-sample
	estimation. In contrast to Orphanides (2002, 2003), I find that the
	Fed's response to the real-time forecast of inflation was weak in
	the second half of the 1970s, perhaps not satisfying Taylor's principle
	as suggested by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000). However, the response
	to inflation was strong before 1973 and gradually regained strength
	from the early 1980s onward. Moreover, as in Orphanides (2003), the

	The core channels of policy transmission -- the neoclassical links

	as long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate,
	and the consequent effects on household and business demand -- have
	remained steady from early policy-oriented models (like the Penn-MIT-SSRC
	MPS model) to modern dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
	models. In contrast, non-neoclassical channels, such as credit-based
	channels, have remained outside the core models. In conjunction with
	this evolution in theory and modeling, there have been notable changes
	in policy behavior (with policy more focused on price stability)
	and in the reduced form correlations of policy interest rates with
	activity in the United States. Regulatory effects on credit provision
	have also changed significantly. As a result, we review the empirical
	evidence on the changes in the effect of monetary policy actions
	on real activity and inflation and present new evidence, using both
	a relatively unrestricted factor-augmented vector autoregression
	(FAVAR) and a DSGE model. Both approaches yield similar results:
	Monetary policy innovations have a more muted effect on real activity
	and inflation in recent decades as compared to the effects before
	1980. Our analysis suggests that these shifts are accounted for by
	changes in policy behavior and the effect of these changes on expectations,
	leaving little role for changes in underlying private-sector behavior
	(outside shifts related to monetary policy changes).},

Using actual data and two identification strategies based on zero restrictions and model-consistent sign restrictions, we find that the positive response of prices to a monetary policy shock is historically limited to the sub-samples that are typically associated with a weak interest rate response to inflation. Using pseudo data generated by a sticky price model of the US economy, we then show that the structural VARs are capable of reproducing the price puzzle only when monetary policy is passive. The omission in the VARs of a variable capturing expected inflation is found to account for the price puzzle observed in simulated and actual data.},

The model proposed enables us to assess whether coefficients evolve gradually over time or are better characterized by infrequent, but large, breaks. Our findings point towards pronounced changes in the international transmission of US monetary policy throughout the sample period, especially so for the reaction of international output, equity prices and exchange rates against the US dollar. In general, the strength of spillovers has weakened in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Using simple panel regressions, we link the variation in international responses to measures of trade and financial globalization. We find that a broad trade base and a high degree of financial integration with the world economy tend to cushion risks stemming from a foreign shock such as US tightening of monetary policy, whereas a reduction in trade barriers and/or a liberalization of the capital account increase these risks.},

The outcomes show that high asset prices more often signal high inflation than low inflation/deflation. However, in some countries, high asset prices and low bond yields are a significant indicator of low inflation or deflation as well. The transmission time of financial developments to inflation can be quite long (up to 8 quarters).

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to gauge quantitatively the macroeconomic impact of EMU membership. Building on the Global VAR framework designed by Pesaran et al. (2004), we want to shed light on the following important questions: What if the euro had never been launched? How would national outputs and inflation rates have evolved? We show that monetary unification promoted lower interest rates and higher output in most euro area (EA) countries, relatively to a situation where national monetary policies would have followed a German-type one. If national monetary policies had adopted British monetary preferences after September 1992 however, this would have led to higher interest rates, depreciations of national exchange rates and higher output in most EA countries, especially over the 1992-1998 period. This is particularly true for the three biggest countries of the EA (France, Germany and Italy). Besides, the single currency regime probably did not have a massive impact on price developments.},

	actions to prevent the economy from collapsing. First, the Federal
	Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the short-term federal funds

	the FOMC began making large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury
	bonds to lower long-term interest rates by reducing the supply of
	long-term assets. The FOMC?s announcement of its intent led to immediate
	and substantial declines in the yields of long-term Treasury bonds,
	but some observers questioned whether such purchases could really
	lower long-term interest rates. ; Doh uses a preferred-habitat model
	that explicitly considers the zero bound for nominal interest rates.
	His analysis suggests that purchasing assets on a large scale can
	effectively lower long-term interest rates. Furthermore, when heightened
	risk aversion disrupts the activities of arbitrageurs, policymakers
	may lower long-term rates more effectively through asset purchases
	than through communicating their intentions to lower the expected
	path of future short-term rates.},

	new empirical estimates of the effects of the maturity structure

	use a model of risk-averse arbitrageurs to develop measures of how
	the maturity structure of debt held by the public might affect the
	pricing of level, slope and curvature term-structure risk. We find
	these Treasury factors historically were quite helpful for predicting
	both yields and excess returns over 1990-2007. The historical correlations
	are consistent with the claim that if in December of 2006, the Fed
	were to have sold off all its Treasury holdings of less than one-year
	maturity (about $400 billion) and use the proceeds to retire Treasury
	debt from the long end, this might have resulted in a 14-basis-point
	drop in the 10-year rate and an 11-basis-point increase in the 6-month
	rate. We also develop a description of how the dynamic behavior of
	the term structure of interest rates changed after hitting the zero
	lower bound in 2009. Our estimates imply that at the zero lower bound,
	such a maturity swap would have the same effects as buying $400 billion
	in long-term maturities outright with newly created reserves, and
	could reduce the 10-year rate by 13 basis points without raising
	short-term yields.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version

	of the CISS is the application of basic portfolio theory to the aggregation
	of five market-specific subindices created from a total of 15 individual
	financial stress measures. The aggregation accordingly takes into
	account the time-varying cross-correlations between the subindices.
	As a result, the CISS puts relatively more weight on situations in
	which stress prevails in several market segments at the same time,
	capturing the idea that financial stress is more systemic and thus
	more dangerous for the economy as a whole if financial instability
	spreads more widely across the whole financial system. Applied to
	euro area data, we determine within a threshold VAR model a systemic
	crisis-level of the CISS at which financial stress tends to depress

	channel in the transmission of monetary shocks to the real economy.
	We first use a simple extension of the Bernanke-Blinder model to
	isolate the observable factors that affect the strength of the lending
	channel. We then show that based on changes in the structure of banks
	assets, reserve requirements, and the composition of external firm
	finance, the lending channel should have been stronger before 1929
	than during the post-World War II period, especially the first half
	of this period. Finally, we demonstrate that conventional indicators
	of the importance of the lending channel, such as the spread between
	the loan rate and the bond rate and the correlation between loans
	and output, do not show the predicted decline in the importance of
	lending over time. From this we conclude that either the traditional
	indicators are not useful measures of the strength of the lending
	channel or that the lending channel has not been quantitatively important

	views about how monetary policy works. In models of small open economies?where
	the monetary transmission mechanism has a relatively strong exchange
	rate channel?the policy rule should also adjust to the exchange rate,
	but the gains from such exchange rate rules over rules that react
	only to inflation and output are small. The results suggest the need
	for more research on both the effect of exchange rate fluctuations
	and on policy rules that take account of exchange rates.<P>(This

	can be summarized as follows: First, we find that monetary policy
	transmits jointly through the interest rate, credit/bank lending
	and wealth channels. Second, we find evidence for changes of both
	responses to a monetary policy shock and volatility characterizing
	the macroeconomic environment. Effects on the macroeconomy are significantly
	lower in the period from 1960 to 2013 than in the early part of our
	sample, whereas responses of short? and long?term interest rates
	are nearly unaltered throughout the sample. Changes in the way the
	Fed conducts monetary policy and different economic environments

  abstract      = {This paper estimates and solves a multi-country version of the standard
	DSGE New Keynesian (NK) model. The country-specific models include
	a Phillips curve determining inflation, an IS curve determining output,
	a Taylor Rule determining interest rates, and a real effective exchange
	rate equation. The IS equation includes a real exchange rate variable
	and a countryspecific foreign output variable to capture direct inter-country
	linkages. In accord with the theory all variables are measured as
	deviations from their steady states, which are estimated as long-horizon
	forecasts from a reduced-form cointegrating global vector autoregression.
	The resulting rational expectations model is then estimated for 33
	countries on data for 1980Q1-2006Q4, by inequality constrained IV,
	using lagged and contemporaneous foreign variables as instruments,
	subject to the restrictions implied by the NK theory. The multi-country
	DSGE NK model is then solved to provide estimates of identified supply,
	demand and monetary policy shocks. Following the literature, we assume
	that the within country supply, demand and monetary policy shocks
	are orthogonal, though shocks of the same type (e.g. supply shocks
	in different countries) can be correlated. We discuss estimation
	of impulse response functions and variance decompositions in such
	large systems, and present estimates allowing for both direct channels
	of international transmission through regression coefficients and
	indirect channels through error spillover effects. Bootstrapped error
	bands are also provided for the cross country responses of a shock
	to the US monetary policy. JEL Classification: C32, E17, F37, F42},

Employing a time-varying vector autoregression with stochastic volatility, our results are two-fold: First, the spread shock works mainly through a boost to consumer wealth growth, while a conventional monetary policy shock affects real output growth via a broad credit/bank lending channel. Second, both shocks exhibit a distinct pattern over our sample period. More specifically, we find small output effects of a conventional monetary policy shock during the period of the global financial crisis and stronger effects in its aftermath. This might imply that when the central bank has left the policy rate unaltered for an extended period of time, a policy surprise might boost output particularly strongly. By contrast, the spread shock has affected output growth most strongly during the period of the global financial crisis and less so thereafter. This might point to diminishing effects of large-scale asset purchase programs.},

	equity prices. The GVAR model contains 27 country-specific models,
	including the United States, 17 European advanced economies, and
	9 European emerging economies. Each country model is linked to the
	others by a set of country-specific foreign variables, computed using
	bilateral bank lending exposures. Results reveal considerable comovements
	of equity prices across mature financial markets. However, the effects
	on credit growth are found to be country-specific. Evidence indicates
	that asset prices are the main channel through which-in the short
	run-financial shocks are transmitted internationally, while the contribution
	of other variables-like the cost and quantity of credit-becomes more
	important over longer horizons.},

	surprises on foreign equity indexes, short- and long-term interest
	rates, and exchange rates in 49 countries. We use two proxies for
	monetary policy surprises: the surprise change to the current target
	federal funds rate (target surprise) and the revision to the expected
	path of future monetary policy (path surprise). We find that different
	asset classes respond to different components of the monetary policy
	surprises. Global equity indexes respond mainly to the target surprise;
	exchange rates and long-term interest rates respond mainly to the
	path surprise; and short-term interest rates respond to both surprises.
	On average, a hypothetical surprise 25-basis-point cut in the federal
	funds target rate is associated with about a 1 percent increase in
	foreign equity indexes and a 5 basis point decline in foreign short-term
	interest rates. A surprise 25-basis-point downward revision in the
	expected path of future policy is associated with about a percent
	decline in the exchange value of the dollar against foreign currencies
	and 5 and 8 basis point declines in short- and long-term interest
	rates, respectively. We also find that asset prices' responses to
	FOMC announcements vary greatly across countries, and that these
	cross-country variations in the response are related to a country's
	exchange rate regime. Equity indexes and interest rates in countries
	with a less flexible exchange rate regime respond more to U.S. monetary
	policy surprises. In addition, the cross-country variation in the
	equity market response is strongly related to the percentage of each
	country's equity market capitalization owned by U.S. investors. This
	result suggests that investors' asset holdings may play a role in
	transmitting monetary policy surprises across countries.},

  abstract      = {<p>Many prominent critics regard the international financial system
	as the dark side of globalization, threatening disadvantaged nations
	near and far. But in<em>The Next Great Globalization</em>, eminent
	economist Frederic Mishkin argues the opposite: that financial globalization
	today is essential for poor nations to become rich. Mishkin argues
	that an effectively managed financial globalization promises benefits
	on the scale of the hugely successful trade and information globalizations
	of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This financial revolution
	can lift developing nations out of squalor and increase the wealth
	and stability of emerging and industrialized nations alike. By presenting
	an unprecedented picture of the potential benefits of financial globalization,
	and by showing in clear and hard-headed terms how these gains can
	be realized, Mishkin provides a hopeful vision of the next phase
	of globalization.</p><p>Mishkin draws on historical examples to caution
	that mismanagement of financial globalization, often aided and abetted
	by rich elites, can wreak havoc in developing countries, but he uses
	these examples to demonstrate how better policies can help poor nations
	to open up their economies to the benefits of global investment.
	According to Mishkin, the international community must provide incentives
	for developing countries to establish effective property rights,
	banking regulations, accounting practices, and corporate governance--the
	institutions necessary to attract and manage global investment. And
	the West must be a partner in integrating the financial systems of
	rich and poor countries--to the benefit of both.</p><p><em>The Next
	Great Globalization</em>makes the case that finance will be a driving
	force in the twenty-first-century economy, and demonstrates how this
	force can and should be shaped to the benefit of all, especially
	the disadvantaged nations most in need of growth and prosperity.</p>},

	of monetary policy in the United States. Monetary policy during the
	1920s and since the 1951 Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord can be broadly
	interpreted in terms of this framework with rather surprising consistency.
	In broad terms, during these periods policy has been generally formulated
	in a forward-looking manner with price stability and economic stability
	serving as implicit or explicit guides. As early as the 1920s, measures
	of real economic activity relative to \&quot;normal\&quot; or \&quot;potential\&quot;
	supply appear to have influenced policy analysis and deliberations.
	Confidence in such measures as guides for activist monetary policy
	proved counterproductive at times, resulting in excessive activism,
	such as during the Great Inflation and at the brink of the Great
	Depression. Policy during the past two decades is broadly consistent
	with natural-growth targeting variants of the Taylor rule that exhibit
	less activism.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version

We split out effects of different types of monetary policy surprises that apply at the ZLB, including forward guidance and asset purchases.

We identify shocks to these expectations at short and long horizons since the early 1980s and examine their effects on contemporaneous macroeconomic outcomes. Our identification uses sign restrictions on survey forecasts incorporated in a structural VAR model to isolate expected deviations from the monetary policy rule. We find that expectations of future policy easing that materialize over the subsequent four quarters √Ø¬ø¬Ω similar to those generated by credible forward guidance √Ø¬ø¬Ω have immediate and persistent stimulative effects on output, inflation and employment. The effects are larger than those produced by an identical shift in the policy path that is not anticipated. Our results are broadly consistent with the mechanism underlying forward guidance in New Keynesian models, but they suggest that those models overstate the persistence of the inflation response. Further, we find that changes in short-rate expectations farther in the future have weaker macroeconomic effects, the opposite of what most New Keynesian models predict.},

Secondly, we also stress that in certain ranges of the parameters, the model is badly conditioned, thus estimated parameters are unstable given small perturbations of the data.

  abstract = {Despite powerful advances in yield curve modeling in the last twenty years, comparatively little attention has been paid to the key practical problem of forecasting the yield curve. In this paper we do so. We use neither the no-arbitrage approach, which focuses on accurately fitting the cross section of interest rates at any given time but neglects time-series dynamics, nor the equilibrium approach, which focuses on time-series dynamics (primarily those of the instantaneous rate) but pays comparatively little attention to fitting the entire cross section at any given time and has been shown to forecast poorly. Instead, we use variations on the Nelson-Siegel exponential components framework to model the entire yield curve, period-by-period, as a three dimensional parameter evolving dynamically. We show that the three time-varying parameters may be interpreted as factors corresponding to level, slope and curvature, and that they may be estimated with high efficiency. We propose and estimate autoregressive models for the factors, and we show that our models are consistent with a variety of stylized facts regarding the yield curve. We use our models to produce term-structure forecasts at both short and long horizons encouraging results. In particular, our forecasts appear much more accurate at long horizons than various standard benchmark forecasts.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},

We estimate a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model estimated using Bayesian techniques. We then explore the effect of three source of inflationary pressure that could drive up inflation expectations: domestic aggregate demand and supply shocks as well as a global increase in oil price inflation. Our results indicate that inflation expectations tend to increase as inflation accelerates. However, the effects of the demand and supply shock are for most countries only short-lived. If domestic inflation accelerates due to a global acceleration of oil price inflation, however, effects are generally more pronounced and long-lasting. This implies that to assess the link between actual inflation and inflation expectations appropriately, it is important to disentangle the underlying sources of inflationary pressure. We also examine whether the relationship between actual inflation and inflation expectations has changed since the global financial crisis. We find that the transmission between inflation and inflation expectations was largely unaffected in response to domestic demand and supply shocks, while effects of an oil price shock on inflation expectations are smaller post-crisis.},

When the time-varying FAVAR is estimated using a large quarterly dataset of US variables from 1972 to 2007, the results indicate some changes in the factor dynamics, and more marked variation in the factors' shock volatility and their loading parameters. Forecasts from the time-varying FAVAR are more accurate than those from a constant parameter FAVAR for most variables and horizons when computed insample, for some variables in pseudo real time, mostly financial indicators. Finally, we use the time-varying FAVAR to assess how monetary transmission to the economy has changed. We find substantial time variation in the volatility of monetary policy shocks, and we observe that the reaction of GDP, the GDP deflator, inflation expectations and long-term interest rates to an equally-sized monetary policy shock has decreased since the early-1980s.},

We apply √¢¬Ä¬údata-rich√¢¬Ä? factor and shrinkage methods to efficiently handle hundreds of predictor series from many countries. The methods covered are principal components, targeted predictors, weighted principal components, partial least squares, elastic net and ridge regression. We find that exploiting a large international dataset can improve forecasts relative to data-rich approaches based on a large national dataset only, and also relative to more traditional approaches based on small datasets. This is in spite of New Zealand√¢¬Ä¬ôs business and consumer confidence and expectations data capturing a substantial proportion of the predictive information in the international data. The largest forecasting accuracy gains from including international predictors are at longer forecast horizons. The forecasting performance achievable with the data-rich methods differs widely, with shrinkage methods and partial least squares performing best in handling the international data.},

Many of these priors are not appropriate for multi-country settings, as they cannot account for the type of restrictions typically met in panel vector autoregressions (PVARs). With this in mind, new parametric and semi-parametric priors for PVARs are proposed, which perform valuable shrinkage in large dimensions and also allow for soft clustering of variables or countries which are homogeneous. The implication of these new priors for modeling interdependencies and heterogeneities among different countries in a panel VAR setting, is discussed. Monte Carlo evidence and an empirical forecasting exercise show clear and important gains from the new priors compared to existing popular priors for VARs and PVARs.},

Our approach allows us to select between or average over all possible combinations of restricted PVARs where the restrictions involve interdependencies between and heterogeneities across cross-sectional units. The resulting BMA framework can find a parsimonious PVAR specification, thus dealing with overparameterization concerns. We use these methods in an application involving the euro area sovereign debt crisis and show that our methods perform better than alternatives. Our findings contradict a simple view of the sovereign debt crisis which divides the euro zone into groups of core and peripheral countries and worries about financial contagion within the latter group.},

We employ a Bayesian dynamic latent factor model to estimate common components in macroeconomic aggregates (output, consumption, and investment) in a 60-country sample covering seven regions of the world. The results indicate that a common world factor is an important source of volatility for aggregates in most countries, providing evidence for a world business cycle. We find that region-specific factors play only a minor role in explaining fluctuations in economic activity. We also document similarities and differences across regions, countries, and aggregates.

The model has economic appeal and provides better out-of-sample yield forecasts at intermediate and long horizons than a number of previously suggested approaches. The forecast improvement is highly significant and particularly pronounced for short and medium-term maturities.},

The FECM combines error-correction, cointegration and dynamic factor models, and has several conceptual advantages over the standard ECM and FAVAR models. In particular, it uses a larger dataset than the ECM and incorporates the long-run information which the FAVAR is missing because of its specification in differences. In this paper, we examine the forecasting performance of the FECM by means of an analytical example, Monte Carlo simulations and several empirical applications. We show that FECM generally offers a higher forecasting precision relative to the FAVAR, and marks a useful step forward for forecasting with large datasets.},
