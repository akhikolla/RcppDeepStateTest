\title{Estimates the position of the observations from its fingerprints and the access point location
usins a logarithmic path loss model}
\usage{
ipfProximity(bpos, rssirange = c(-100, 0), norssi = NA, alpha = 5,
  wapPow1 = -30)
}
\arguments{
\item{bpos}{a matrix or a data frame containing the position of the beacons,
in the same order as they appear in fingerprints}

\item{rssirange}{range of the RSSI data}

\item{norssi}{value used to represent a not detected AP}

\item{alpha}{path loss exponent}

\item{wapPow1}{detected RSSI at one meter range}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class ipfEstimation, with the following properties:
                    location  ->   a matrix with the predicted locations
                    errors    ->   a numeric vector with the errors, if loctest has been provided
                    neighbors ->   NULL
                    weights   ->   NULL
}
\description{
Estimates the position of the observations from its fingerprints and the access point location

\examples{

    ipfEst <- ipfProximity(ipftrain[1:10, 1:168], ipfpwap, ipftrain[1:10, 169:170], alpha = 4)
