\usage{
corrcov_nvar_bhat(
  bhat,
  V,
  N0,
  N1,
  Sigma,
  nvar,
  thr,
  W = 0.2,
  nrep = 10000,
  pp0min = 0.001
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bhat}{Estimated effect sizes from single-SNP logistic regressions}

\item{V}{Variance of estimated effect sizes}

\item{N0}{Number of controls}

\item{N1}{Number of cases}

\item{Sigma}{SNP correlation matrix}

\item{nvar}{The number of variants that simulated credible sets used for estimation should contain}

\item{thr}{Minimum threshold for fine-mapping experiment}

\item{W}{Prior for the standard deviation of the effect size parameter, beta (default 0.2)}

\item{nrep}{The number of simulated posterior probability systems to consider for the corrected coverage estimate (nrep = 10000 default due to trimming)}

\item{pp0min}{Only average over SNPs with pp0 > pp0min}
}
\value{
Corrected coverage estimate
}
\description{
Obtain corrected coverage estimate using estimated effect sizes and their standard errors (limiting simulations used for estimation to those with correct nvar)
}
\details{
This function requires the marginal summary statistics from GWAS and an nvar value. It should only be used when nvar is very low ($<3$) and there is some evidence to suggest that only simulated credible sets with this nvar value should be used to derive the corrected coverage estimate.

nsnps <- 100
N0 <- 5000 # number of controls
N1 <- 5000 # number of cases

## generate example LD matrix

S <- (1 - (abs(outer(1:nsnps,1:nsnps,`-`))/nsnps))^4
X <- simx(nsnps,nsamples,S)
LD <- cor2(X)
maf <- colMeans(X)

varbeta <- Var.data.cc(f = maf, N = N0 + N1, s = N1/(N0+N1))

bhats = rnorm(nsnps,0,0.2) # log OR

corrcov_nvar_bhat(bhat = bhats, V = varbeta, N0, N1, Sigma = LD, thr = 0.95, nvar = 1, nrep = 1000)

# note that nrep should be at least the default value (nrep = 10000) but is
# lower here for speed of computation
