\title{
Sequential pivotal method (also known as ordered pivotal sampling and Deville's systematic sampling)
}
\description{
Select samples with prescribed inclusion probabilities from a finite population. The resulting samples are well spread in the list (similar to systematic sampling). In each of the (at most) N steps, two undecided units with smallest index are selected to compete.
}
\usage{
spm(prob)	
}
\arguments{
  \item{prob}{vector of length N with inclusion probabilities}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of selected indexes in 1,2,...,N. If the inclusion probabilities sum to n, where n is integer, then the sample size is fixed (n).
