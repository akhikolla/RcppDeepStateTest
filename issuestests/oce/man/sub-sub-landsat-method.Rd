\usage{
\S4method{[[}{landsat}(x, i, j, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \linkS4class{landsat} object.}

\item{i}{Character string indicating the name of an item to extract.}

\item{j}{Optional additional information on the \code{i} item.}

\item{...}{Optional additional information (ignored).}
}
\description{
The \code{[[} method works for all \code{oce} objects, i.e.
objects inheriting from \linkS4class{oce}.  The purpose
is to insulate users from the internal details of \code{oce}
objects, by looking for items within the various storage
slots of the object. Items that are not actually stored in
the object can also be extracted, including derived data such
as potential temperature, the units of measurement for
the data, data-quality flags, etc.
}
\details{
A two-step process is used to try to find the
requested information. First, a class-specific function
tries to find it, but
if that fails, then a general function is used
(see next section).

\section{Details of the general method}{


If the specialized method produces no matches, the following generalized
method is applied. As with the specialized method, the procedure hinges
first on the values of \code{i} and, optionally, \code{j}. The work
proceeds in steps, by testing a sequence of possible conditions
in sequence.
\enumerate{
\item A check is made as to whether \code{i} names one of the standard
\code{oce} slots. If so, \code{[[} returns the slot contents of that slot.
Thus, \code{x[["metadata"]]} will retrieve the \code{metadata} slot,
while \code{x[["data"]]} and \code{x[["processingLog"]]} return
those slots.
\item If \code{i} is a string ending in the
\code{"Unit"}, then the characters preceding that string
are taken to be the name of an item in the data object, and a list
containing the unit is returned. This list consists of an item
named \code{unit}, which is an \code{\link[=expression]{expression()}}, and
an item named \code{scale}, which is a string describing the
measurement scale.  If the string ends in \code{" unit"}, e.g.
\code{x[["temperature unit"]]} (note the space),
then just the expression is returned, and if it ends in
\code{" scale"}, then just the scale is returned.
\item If \code{i} is a string ending in \code{"Flag"}, then the corresponding
data-quality flag is returned (or \code{NULL} if there is no such flag).
For example, \code{x[["salinityFlag"]]} returns a vector of salinity
flags if \code{x} is a ctd object.
\item If \code{i} is \code{"sigmaTheta"}, then the value of
\code{\link[=swSigmaTheta]{swSigmaTheta()}} is called with \code{x} as the sole
argument, and the results are returned. Similarly,
\code{\link[=swSigma0]{swSigma0()}} is used if \code{i="sigma0"}, and
\code{\link[=swSpice]{swSpice()}} is used if \code{i="spice"}. Of course, these
actions only make sense for objects that contain
the relevant items within their \code{data} slot.
\item After these possibilities are eliminated,
the action depends on whether \code{j} has been provided.
If \code{j} is not provided, or is the string \code{""},
then \code{i} is sought
in the \code{metadata} slot, and then in the \code{data} slot,
returning whichever is found first.  In other words, if \code{j}
is not provided, the \code{metadata} slot takes preference over
the \code{data} slot. However, if \code{j} is provided, then
it must be either the string \code{"metadata"} or \code{"data"},
and it directs where to look.
}

If none of the above-listed conditions holds, then \code{NULL} is returned,
without the issuance of a warning or error message. (This silent operation
is employed so that \code{[[} will behave like the normal R version.)

\section{Details of the specialized \code{landsat} method}{


Users are isolated from the details of the two-byte storage system
by using the \code{[[} operator.

\emph{Accessing band data.}  The data may be accessed with e.g.
\code{landsat[["panchromatic"]]}, for the panchromatic band.  If a new
``band'' is added with \code{\link[=landsatAdd]{landsatAdd()}}, it may be referred by
name.  In all cases, a second argument can be provided, to govern
decimation.  If this is missing, all the relevant data are returned.  If
this is present and equal to \code{TRUE}, then the data will be
automatically decimated (subsampled) to give approximately 800 elements in
the longest side of the matrix.  If this is present and numerical, then its
value governs decimation.  For example,
\code{landsat[["panchromatic",TRUE]]} will auto-decimate, typically
reducing the grid width and height from 16000 to about 800.  Similarly,
\code{landsat[["panchromatic",10]]} will reduce width and height to about
1600.  On machines with limited RAM (e.g. under about 6GB), decimation is a
good idea in almost all processing steps.  It also makes sense for
plotting, and in fact is done through the `decimate` argument of
\code{\link[=plot,landsat-method]{plot,landsat-method()}}.

\emph{Accessing derived data.}  One may retrieve several derived quantities
that are calculated from data stored in the object:
\code{landsat[["longitude"]]} and \code{landsat[["latitude"]]} give pixel
locations.  Accessing \code{landsat[["temperature"]]} creates an estimate
of ground temperature as follows (see reference 4).  First, the ``count value'' in
band 10, denoted \eqn{b_{10}}{b_10} say, is scaled with coefficients stored
in the image metadata using
\eqn{\lambda_L=b_{10}M_L+A_L}{lambda_L=b_10*M_L+A_L} where \eqn{M_L}{M_L}
and \eqn{A_L}{A_L} are values stored in the metadata (e.g.  the first in
\code{landsat@metadata$header$radiance_mult_band_10}) Then the result is
used, again with coefficients in the metadata, to compute Celcius
temperature \eqn{T=K_2/ln(\epsilon
    K_1/\lambda_L+1)-273.15}{T=K_2/ln(epsilon*K_1/\lambda_L+1)-273.15}.
The value of the emissivity \eqn{\epsilon}{epsilon} is set to unity by
\code{\link[=read.landsat]{read.landsat()}}, although it can be changed easily later, by
assigning a new value to `landsat@metadata$emissivity`. The default
emissivity value set by \code{\link[=read.landsat]{read.landsat()}} is from reference 11, and is
within the oceanic range suggested by reference 5. Adjustment is as simple as
altering `landsat@metadata$emissivity`. This value can be a single
number meant to apply for the whole image, or a matrix with dimensions
matching those of band 10.  The matrix case is probably more useful for
images of land, where one might wish to account for the different
emissivities of soil and vegetation, etc.; for example, Table 4 of
reference 9 lists 0.9668 for soil and 0.9863 for vegetation,
while Table 5 of reference 10 lists 0.971 and 0.987 for the same quantities.

\emph{Accessing metadata.} Anything in the metadata can be accessed by
name, e.g. \code{landsat[["time"]]}.  Note that some items are simply
copied over from the source data file and are not altered by e.g.
decimation.  An exception is the lat-lon box, which is altered by
\code{\link[=landsatTrim]{landsatTrim()}}.
