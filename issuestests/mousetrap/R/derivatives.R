#' Calculate distance, velocity, and acceleration.
#'
#' Calculate distance traveled, velocity, and acceleration for each logged 
#' position. Distance is calculated as the Euclidean distance between successive
#' coordinates, and velocity as distance covered per time interval. The 
#' acceleration denotes the difference in absolute velocity, again normalized
#' per time.
#'
#' Distances, velocities and acceleration are computed as follows:
#'
#' The first entry in each respective vector is always zero. Each subsequent
#' entry thus represents the Euclidean distance traveled since the previous
#' recorded set of coordinates and the velocity with which the movement between
#' both samples took place. Thus, both distance and velocity represent the
#' intervening period between the previous sample and the one with which the
#' numeric value is saved.
#'
#' The acceleration, by contrast, denotes the change in absolute velocity
#' between two adjacent periods. Because of this, it is shifted forward to best
#' match the actual time point at which the acceleration was measured. Because
#' there will always be one less value computed for acceleration than for
#' velocity, the final value in the acceleration vector has been padded with an
#' NA.
#'
#' If the distance is calculated across both horizontal and vertical (x and y) 
#' dimensions, distance and velocity is always positive (or 0). If only one 
#' dimension is used, by default (\code{absolute=FALSE}), increases in x (or y)
#' values result in positive distances and velocity values, decreases in
#' negative distances and velocity values. If \code{absolute=TRUE}, absolute
#' values for distance and velocity are reported.
#'
#' @inheritParams mt_time_normalize
#' @param dimensions a character vector specifying across which dimension(s)
#'   distances, velocity, and acceleration are calculated. By default
#'   (\code{c("xpos","ypos")}), they are calculated across both x and y
#'   dimensions. Alternatively, only one dimension can be specified, e.g.,
#'   \code{"xpos"} or \code{"ypos"}.
#' @param timestamps a character string specifying the trajectory dimension
#'   containing the timestamps.
#' @param prefix an optional character string that is added as a prefix to the
#'   to be created new trajectory dimensions.
#' @param absolute logical indicating if absolute values for distances and
#'   velocities should be reported. Only relevant if a single dimension is
#'   specified in \code{dimensions} (see Details).
#' @param return_delta_time logical indicating if the timestamp differences 
#'   should be returned as well (as "delta_time").
#'
#' @return A mousetrap data object (see \link{mt_example}) with Euclidian 
#'   distance, velocity, and acceleration added as additional variables to the 
#'   trajectory array (called \code{dist}, \code{vel}, and  \code{acc}, if no 
#'   prefix was specified). If the trajectory array was provided directly as 
#'   \code{data}, only the trajectory array will be returned.
