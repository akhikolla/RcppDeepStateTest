\description{
A small data frame of simulated records as might be found in a population census. This data is used to demonstrate the package's algorithms in a more realistic setting. It also allows for reproduction of the example towards the end of the paper that accompanies this package. The data is a subset of a larger set simulated by of P. McLeod, R. Heasman and I. Forbes of the UK's Office for National Statistics. At the time of publication this data is available at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/job-training_en.
