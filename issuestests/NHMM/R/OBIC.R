#' Calculates BIC, AIC, PLS, log-likelihood
#'
#' \code{OBIC} calculates BIC, AIC, approximate log-likelihood and plots the
#' log-likelihood for all iterations. The log-likelihood plot should 
#' be flat to show convergence to a stationary distribution. Minimize 
#' the AIC and BIC for the *best* model and maximize PLS.  The log likelihood is approximate in that
#' it is calculated by marginalizing over the current chain of hidden states instead
#' of using a recurrsive algorithm to compute it; every iterations produces an estimation
#' of the log-likelihood.  If yhold is provided the preditive log score (PLS) is also 
#' given. 
#' 
#' Predictive Log Score: mean(log( E(p(yhold|...)))  The expectation is over all of the
#' iterations of the algorithm.  And the mean is over the pT count of yhold. The scale of
#' the PLS is in the unit of t (usually days). 
#' 
#' @param nhmmobj an object created from the NHMM function
#' @param outfile a directory to put the .png plot
#' @return BIC  
#' @return output: AIC, BIC, PLS [if yhold data was provided], log-likelihood to the GUI and a plot of the log-likelihood
