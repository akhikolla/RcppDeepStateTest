Description: Contains Rcpp and RcppEigen implementations of matrix operations useful for Gaussian process models, such as the inversion of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix, sampling from multivariate normal distributions, evaluation of the log-density of a multivariate normal vector, and Bayesian inference for latent variable Gaussian process models with elliptical slice sampling (Murray, Adams, and MacKay 2010).
