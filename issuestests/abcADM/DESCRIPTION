Description: Estimate parameters of accumulated damage (load duration) models based on failure time data under a Bayesian framework, using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Assess long-term reliability under stochastic load profiles. Yang, Zidek, and Wong (2019) <doi:10.1080/00401706.2018.1512900>.
