\title{
Calculate various imbalance statistics for a tree.
}
\description{
Given a rooted phylogenetic tree, calculate various "imbalance" statistics of the tree, such as Colless' Index or Sackin's Index.
}
\usage{
tree_imbalance(tree, type)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{tree}{
A rooted tree of class "phylo".
}
\item{type}{
Character, specifying the statistic to be calculated. Must be one of "Colless" (Shao 1990), "Colless_normalized" (Colless normalized by the maximum possible value in the case of a bifurcating tree) or "Sackin" (Sackin 1972).
}
}


\details{
The tree may include multifurcations and monofurcations. Note that the Colless Index is traditionally only defined for bifurcating trees. For non-bifurcating trees this function calculates a generalization of the index, by summing over all children pairs at each node.
}

\value{
Numeric, the requested imbalance statistic of the tree.
}
