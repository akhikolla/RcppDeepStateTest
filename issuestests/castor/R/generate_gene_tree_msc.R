# generate a random gene tree, based on the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model
# in the MSC, every branch of the species tree has an effective population size (Ne) and generation time (T),
#   and gene alleles coalesce backward in time according to the Wright-Fisher model 
#   and depending on the branch's population size and generation time.
# This model does not account for gene duplication/loss, nor for hybridization or horizontal gene transfer
# It is only meant to model "incomplete lineage sorting", otherwise known as "deep coalescence",
#   which is one of the many mechanisms that can cause discordance between gene trees and species trees.
# Main input:
#   Rooted time-calibrated species tree (not necessarily ultrametric, i.e. extinct lineages are allowed)
#   Effective population sizes and generation times for each edge in the tree
#   Number of alleles sampled at each tip
